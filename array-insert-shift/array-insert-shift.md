## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I devide the process into two parts the first part fill the new array to the middle index from the original array plus the new added value and the second part take the rest of orignal array and fill the new array with them.

Its a simple way to insert a value inside an array.

This approach take extra time to loop twice in it but its good from space point of view.
